###Ardoq Assignment ###

**Description**
  At Ardoq we believe that API testing is critical for automating testing because APIs now
  serve as the primary interface to application logic and with API testing QA’s are able to start
  testing from early on in the Software development lifecycle.

The API automation suite  consist of the following:
● Create a new user using API -> POST To Create/Register User Account
● Edit any details for your user using API -> PUT METHOD To Update User Account
● Delete user using API -> DELETE METHOD To Delete User Account
